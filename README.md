# Paper notes
This repository contains my paper reading notes on deep learning and machine learning. It is inspired by [Patrick Liu](https://github.com/patrick-llgc/Learning-Deep-Learning), and in turn [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes) and [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes).
